## ü§î What is this project?

Think of this project as a **digital health monitor for your applications** - just like how a hospital monitor shows a patient's vital signs, this tool shows the "vital signs" of all your software applications running in the cloud.

**In simple terms:** This is a web service that automatically checks if your applications are running properly, having problems, or completely stopped. It gives you an easy way to see the health status of everything at once, instead of checking each application one by one.

**Real-world analogy:** Imagine you're a building manager responsible for 100 offices. Instead of walking to each office to see if people are working, you have a central dashboard that shows which offices are:
- ‚úÖ **Running normally** (people working)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Having issues** (some problems but still working)  
- ‚ùå **Completely down** (empty office)
- ‚è≥ **Starting up** (people arriving)

## üéØ What is it for?

### Primary Use Cases

**For System Administrators:**
- Monitor all applications in your company's cloud infrastructure
- Quickly identify which services are having problems

## üöÄ How to Use

### Basic Usage

Once the service is running, you have three main ways to get information:

#### 1. **Check Service Status**
**URL:** `http://your-server:3000/health`

**What it does:** Tells you if the monitoring service itself is working properly.

**Example response:**
```json
{
  "name": "Health Dashboard API",
  "version": "0.1.0", 
  "status": "healthy"
}
```

#### 2. **Get Service Information**
**URL:** `http://your-server:3000/`

**What it does:** Shows basic information about the monitoring service.

**Example response:**
```json
{
  "name": "Health Dashboard API",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "status": "running"
}
```

#### 3. **Get All Application Health Status**
**URL:** `http://your-server:3000/pods`

**What it does:** Shows detailed health information for all applications in your cluster.

**Example response:**
```json
{
  "total_pods": 25,
  "running_pods": 20,
  "failed_pods": 2,
  "pending_pods": 3,
  "pods": [
    {
      "name": "web-application-1",
      "namespace": "production",
      "status": "Running",
      "ready": true,
      "restart_count": 0,
      "containers": [
        {
          "name": "web-server",
          "ready": true,
          "restart_count": 0
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "database-backup-job",
      "namespace": "production", 
      "status": "Failed",
      "ready": false,
      "restart_count": 5,
      "containers": [
        {
          "name": "backup-script",
          "ready": false,
          "restart_count": 5
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Understanding the Results

**Summary Information:**
- `total_pods`: Total number of applications found
- `running_pods`: Applications that are working normally
- `failed_pods`: Applications that have crashed or failed
- `pending_pods`: Applications that are starting up

**Individual Application Information:**
- `name`: The name of the application
- `namespace`: Which team/project owns this application
- `status`: Current state (Running, Failed, Pending, etc.)
- `ready`: Whether the application is ready to handle requests
- `restart_count`: How many times this application had to be restarted
- `containers`: Individual components within the application

### Practical Examples

#### Example 1: Quick Health Check
**Scenario:** You want to quickly see if everything is running fine.

**Action:** Visit `http://your-server:3000/pods` and look at the summary:
- If `failed_pods` is 0, everything is healthy
- If `failed_pods` is greater than 0, some applications need attention

#### Example 2: Finding Problem Applications
**Scenario:** You know something is wrong and want to find which application is causing problems.

**Action:** Visit `http://your-server:3000/pods` and look for applications where:
- `status` is "Failed" 
- `ready` is false
- `restart_count` is high (more than 5-10 restarts might indicate a persistent problem)

#### Example 3: Monitoring During Deployment
**Scenario:** You're deploying new applications and want to see them start up.

**Action:** Refresh `http://your-server:3000/pods` periodically and watch for:
- New applications appearing in the list
- Applications changing from "Pending" to "Running"
- `ready` status changing from false to true

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### General Questions

**Q: Do I need to know programming to use this?**
A: No! You can use this tool by simply visiting web addresses in your browser. The installation requires some basic command-line knowledge, but day-to-day usage is just clicking links.

**Q: Will this slow down my applications?**
A: No. This tool only reads information from Kubernetes - it doesn't change or interfere with your applications in any way.

**Q: How often does the information update?**
A: The information is real-time. Every time you visit the web address, it gets the current status directly from your Kubernetes cluster.

### Installation Questions

**Q: What is Kubernetes and do I need it?**
A: Kubernetes is a system for running applications in containers (think of them as lightweight virtual machines). Yes, you need a Kubernetes cluster for this tool to monitor. If you don't have one, this tool won't be useful for you.

**Q: Can I run this on Windows/Mac/Linux?**
A: Yes! The Docker version works on all operating systems. The Kubernetes version works regardless of the operating system since it runs inside the cluster.

**Q: Do I need special permissions?**
A: Yes, the application needs permission to read information from your Kubernetes cluster. If you're running it inside Kubernetes, it can often get these permissions automatically. If you're running it locally, you'll need a kubeconfig file with read access.

### Usage Questions

**Q: What does "namespace" mean?**
A: A namespace is like a folder that groups related applications together. For example, you might have a "production" namespace for live applications and a "testing" namespace for experimental applications.

**Q: Why would an application need to restart?**
A: Applications restart for many reasons: software bugs, running out of memory, configuration changes, or updates. Occasional restarts (1-2) are normal, but many restarts might indicate a problem.

**Q: What's the difference between "status" and "ready"?**
A: "Status" tells you the overall state (Running, Failed, etc.). "Ready" tells you if the application can actually handle work. An application might be "Running" but not "Ready" if it's still starting up.

### Troubleshooting

**Q: I get "connection refused" errors**
A: This usually means:
- The service isn't running (check if the container started successfully)
- You're using the wrong port (make sure you're accessing port 3000)
- There's a firewall blocking the connection

**Q: I see "Error getting pods" in the response**
A: This means the service can't connect to your Kubernetes cluster. Check:
- Are you running in a Kubernetes cluster with proper permissions?
- Is your kubeconfig file correct (if running locally)?
- Does the service account have read permissions?

**Q: The service starts but shows no applications**
A: This could mean:
- You're looking at an empty Kubernetes cluster
- The service doesn't have permission to read from all namespaces
- You're connected to the wrong Kubernetes cluster
